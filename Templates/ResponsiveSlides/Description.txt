<h3>Template Description</h3>
<p><a href="http://responsiveslides.com/">ResponsiveSlides.js</a> is a tiny jQuery plugin that creates a responsive slider using elements inside a container. It has been used on sites like <a href="http://www.buildwindows.com/launch">Microsoft's Build 2012</a> and <a href="https://gridsetapp.com">Gridset App</a>. ResponsiveSlides.js works with wide range of browsers including all IE versions from IE6 and up. It also adds CSS max-width support for IE6 and other browsers that don't natively support it. Only dependency is <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a> (1.6 and up supported, tested up to 1.8.3) and that all the images are the same size.</p>

<p>Biggest difference to other responsive slider plugins is the file size (1.4kb minified and gzipped) + that this one doesn't try to do everything. ResponsiveSlides.js has basically only two different modes: Either it just automatically fades the images, or operates as a responsive image container with pagination and/or navigation to fade between slides.</p>
