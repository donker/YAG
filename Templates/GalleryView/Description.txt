Photo gallery jQuery plugins are everywhere you turn. Not a week goes by without some web design blog featuring a list of jQuery galleries, carousels, sliders and slideshows. GalleryView is my attempt to write a single plugin capable of creating a wide variety of gallery types.<br/>
My goal with GalleryView is to provide an extensive set of options to the user. Not only will the user be able to adjust photo and thumbnail sizes, and transition speeds, but he will also have the ability to choose from a selection of element positions, transition styles and other features. <a href="http://spaceforaname.com/galleryview/" target="_new">Read more ...</a>
